# leaflet-challenge

For this assignment an earthquake visualiation was created. First, we used the URL http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php to pull data for visualization. Using Leaflet,a map was created that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers were created to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
A legend was created to provide context for the map data.

Utilized: geoJSON, Leaflet, D3
